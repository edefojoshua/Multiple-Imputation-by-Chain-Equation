This analysis applied multiple imputation to handle missing data before regression modelling. The dataset was imported and examined to identify variable types and missing-data patterns. An initial ordinary least squares regression using listwise deletion was estimated for comparison. Missing values were then addressed using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), with 50 imputations and 10 iterations to ensure stable estimates. Convergence and plausibility of imputations were assessed using diagnostic plots. Regression models were fitted separately to each imputed dataset, and the results were pooled to obtain final parameter estimates and model fit statistics. This approach reduced bias and improved efficiency compared to listwise deletion, providing more reliable regression results.
